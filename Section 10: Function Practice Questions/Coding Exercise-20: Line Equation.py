# Problem Description:

# You are given the slope m and the y-intercept b of a line, along with a value x. 
# Your task is to calculate and return the value of y using the equation of a line in slope-intercept form:
# y=mx+b

# Input:
# Three floating-point numbers: slope, intercept, and x.

# Output:
# A floating-point number representing the value of yyy corresponding to the given xxx.

# Example:
# Input: slope = 2, intercept = 3, x = 4
# Output: 11.0

# Input: slope = 1.5, intercept = -2, x = 2
# Output: 1.0

# Solution:
